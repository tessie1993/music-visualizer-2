 * moment the vocal comes in. They are placed by hand or tapped in live while the music plays, and
 * everything else in the editor (clip snapping, keyframe snapping, auto-cut suggestions) is
 * expressed against them rather than against any tempo grid.

 * How late a tap lands by default: human reaction to a hit sits around 100 ms and Android's audio
 * output adds a little more, so a tap is nudged back by this much to land where the user felt it.
 * The raw tap is kept on the marker so the whole session can be re-nudged later.
