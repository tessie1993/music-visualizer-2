# Rebuilding libprojectM for Android

The two shared objects the MilkDrop style needs live in the repository, once
per ABI:

```
app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/libprojectM-4.so     the engine (LGPL-2.1, dynamically linked), STOCK v4.1.7
app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/libmilkdropjni.so    the JNI bridge built from tools/milkdrop_jni.c
```

The APK ships `arm64-v8a` (devices) and `x86_64` (emulators). The x86_64 pair
is not a courtesy: the CI instrumented suite runs on an x86_64 emulator, and
without libs for it `MilkdropEngine.available` is false there — which made
the whole MilkDrop pipeline untestable off a phone, and is how a silently
black MilkDrop shipped past a fully green build more than once.
`MilkdropRenderInstrumentedTest` is the gate that renders real frames on the
emulator and fails on a black one.

> **Do not build these by hand.** `.github/workflows/native-libs.yml` ("Rebuild
> native libs (16 KB aligned)") automates the whole recipe below, and it is the
> only route that gets the page alignment right: NDK r28, the explicit
> `max-page-size=16384` linker flags, and a `readelf` check that fails the run
> if any ELF LOAD segment comes out below 16384. Google Play requires 16 KB page
> support for apps targeting Android 15+, and a hand build that misses it fails
> silently until the app will not load on a device.
>
> Run it from Actions with the projectM release tag as input. It uploads the two
> stripped .so files as the `jniLibs-arm64-v8a-16k` artifact — it does **not**
> commit them. Download it, drop both into `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` and
> commit; the gate in `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-checks the alignment of
> whatever is committed, so a hand-built .so that slipped through is caught
> before a release rather than on a phone.
>
> A fresh engine build is not a repackage: run the MilkDrop items in
> `docs/DEVICE_CHECKS.md` (1-4, 33) afterwards.

## The engine is stock — no patches

The engine is built from the upstream release tag exactly as shipped.
`projectm_opengl_render_frame` ends its frame on the DEFAULT framebuffer (the
only target where upstream's `glDrawBuffers(GL_BACK)` is legal), and
`MilkdropScene` copies the frame off framebuffer 0 into its own texture for
the post/composite pipeline.

An earlier integration patched a render-to-FBO API onto the engine
(`projectm_opengl_render_frame_fbo`), and the patch went stale twice — once
declaring the symbol without defining it (JNI link death on a device), once
leaving `GL_BACK` set on a framebuffer object (MilkDrop permanently black on
conformant drivers). The rebuild's premise is that there is no patch to go
stale; `MilkdropIntegrationTest` fails the build if a `.patch` reappears in
`tools/` or an apply step reappears in the workflow.

## Upstream survey (why v4.1.7 + copy, and not the alternatives)

- **projectM master** now carries `projectm_opengl_render_frame_fbo`
  officially (`@since 4.2.0`, unreleased), with the correct per-target draw
  buffer — the API the old patch backported. It is still not the right base:
  master's Glad/GLResolver bootstrap hard-gates on **GLES 3.2 + GLSL ES
  3.20** and a runtime GL resolver, which rejects ES 3.0/3.1 devices this app
  supports (minSdk 26), and a master build already shipped one all-black
  MilkDrop (the v0.3.2 bug). Revisit when 4.2 is a release and the context
  gate has settled.
- **MilkDrop3** (milkdrop2077/MilkDrop3) is the Windows Direct3D lineage of
  the original Winamp plugin. Its preset semantics are what projectM
  reimplements; none of its rendering code is portable to Android GLES.
  projectM IS the open-source MilkDrop for GLES — there is no closer source.
- The v4.1.7 copy-from-framebuffer-0 integration was validated end to end on
  a real GLES 3 implementation (mesa) with the scene's exact GL state,
  including a loaded starter preset: engine output, the copy, and the post
  input all non-black. The same flow runs on the CI emulator via
  `MilkdropRenderInstrumentedTest`.

## The recipe the workflow implements

```
# IMPORTANT: build from a release tag, never master. master carries an
# experimental GL bootstrap (GLResolver/GladLoader "strict context gate") that
# is in no release; the .so it produces has no GLES linkage at all, so
# projectm_create can fail on-device and the style renders black with no error
# anywhere. This was the root cause of the v0.3.2 MilkDrop bug.

## Adding an ABI

Repeat the cmake/ninja/clang steps per ABI, drop each pair into its own
`jniLibs/<abi>/` directory, and extend `abiFilters` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
Every ABI is checked by the same alignment gate.
