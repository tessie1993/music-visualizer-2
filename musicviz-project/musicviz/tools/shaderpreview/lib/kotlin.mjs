// Reads the uniform names a Kotlin scene actually uploads, straight out of
// its source.
//
// This is the whole reason to trust anything this tool renders. A preview
// harness that invents its own uniform values is a drawing of a shader, not a
// preview of a style: a uniform the harness forgets defaults to zero in GL,
// and a zeroed uniform is indistinguishable from a feature that is switched
// off. `uHasMelt = 0` is precisely that failure, and it is the difference
// between HYPERSPACE's whole medium being there and not.
//
// So the tool does a three-way audit per scene:
//
//   A. what the SHADER declares          (glsl.parseUniforms)
//   B. what the KOTLIN uploads           (here)
//   C. what the HARNESS supplies         (lib/scenes.mjs)
//
// A \ C is fatal - something would silently be zero.
// B \ C is fatal - the harness has drifted behind the app.
// C \ B is fatal - the harness is inventing inputs the app never sends.
// A \ B is reported as a shader-side finding (the app never sets it either).
