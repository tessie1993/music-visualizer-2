# On-device verification (GL/native can't be checked headless)

Run after installing musicviz-debug.apk. Log: `adb logcat -s projectM-jni`

1. MilkDrop render: Style > MilkDrop > load a .milk. Expect motion, no
   solid black. Log shows preset load; errors surface via GetLastError.
2. Texture "Use": Textures > import a jpg/png > Use. Expect the image in
   the feedback loop. If black: capture the log block and the generated
   show_<name>.milk from files/milk/generated/.
3. Customizations on .milk: with a milk preset live, sweep warp, kaleido,
   tile, drift, sway, flash, temperature, invert, chroma, vignette — each
   must visibly change the output (composite path).
4. Preset roundtrip live: customize heavily > save > switch scenes > apply
   the preset. Expect scene + every slider position + shader restored.
5. Flicker: play a hi-hat-heavy track. Default Beat threshold (2.5σ)
   should not strobe; lowering the slider should visibly increase beat
   response, raising it should calm it.
6. Zoom AA: set Zoom high on julia/mandel — edges stay smooth
   (supersampled FBOs), no blocky texels.
7. Export parity: dial in FX + LFO on a particle scene, export 10 s.
   The mp4 must match the live look (FX chain, LFO motion, trails).
