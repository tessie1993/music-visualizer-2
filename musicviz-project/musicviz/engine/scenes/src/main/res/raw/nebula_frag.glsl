// NEBULA - a volumetric fbm cloud, lit from inside.
//
// The only style in this family with no surface in it. Nothing is ever "hit":
// the ray integrates emission and absorption through a participating medium
// and stops when there is nothing left to see through. Beer-Lambert, one slab
// at a time, in CLOSED FORM over the slab rather than as emission times
// length:
//
//     absorbed = 1 - exp(-density * extinction * ds)
//     col     += emission * T * absorbed
//     T       *= 1 - absorbed
//
// The two forms agree to first order in ds, but only this one carries the
// medium's radiance ceiling at ANY step size - which matters here because ds
// is set by the user's Detail control, and a style whose brightness moved with
// a quality slider would be unusable. hyperspace_frag integrates its liquid
// light the same way for the same reason.
//
// The ordering matters too. Emission is deposited with the transmittance the
// ray arrived WITH, before this slab absorbs anything; a slab cannot occlude
// itself. The other way round darkens the near face of every cloud and the
// medium loses its front.
//
// ---- why this cannot flash ------------------------------------------------
//
// The app has a photosensitivity budget, and an emissive volume is exactly the
// kind of thing that blows through one. It cannot here, and the reason is the
// integral rather than a clamp: the weights T * absorbed over a ray sum to
// 1 - T_final <= 1 by construction, so the accumulated radiance is a convex
// combination of the emission values along the ray and can never exceed the
// largest of them. Emission is then soft-clipped at NEB_EMIT_CEILING before it
// enters the sum, which makes that a hard per-pixel bound: no pixel leaves this
// shader brighter than NEB_EMIT_CEILING, whatever the music or the fingers do.
// Louder music cannot brighten the frame past it - it can only reach it sooner.
//
// The one term with real transient energy, the beat shock, is a THIN expanding
// shell: a ring on screen, never a full field, and it fades as it travels.
// Nothing here changes large-area luminance in one frame.

 * siblings at the same Detail setting, which is not what the user moving one
 * slider is asking for. So it spends a fixed FRACTION of the budget: Detail
