// MORPHOGEN - one organism, continuously metamorphosing between skeletons.
//
// There is exactly one body in this scene and it is never the same shape for
// long. Its distance field is a linear blend of four estimators that describe
// completely different solids - a woven minimal surface, a folded/inverted
// solid, a cluster of fused blobs and a hard faceted crystal - and the blend
// runs on the DISTANCES rather than on any geometry:
//
//     d = mix(dA, dB, t)
//
// That one line is the reason this style exists. A blendshape can only
// interpolate vertices, so it can never change topology: a sphere cannot
// become a torus without tearing, and a solid cannot become a woven sheet at
// all. A convex combination of two signed distance fields has no such
// restriction - the zero set of the blend passes through every intermediate
// topology on its own, opening holes and closing them wherever the two fields
// cross. The intermediate states are not poses of either skeleton; they are
// shapes neither one contains, and they are what the eye reads as growth.
//
// The blend also stays MARCHABLE for free. Both inputs never overestimate the
// distance to their own surface, and a convex combination of two functions
// that are each 1-Lipschitz is 1-Lipschitz, so the blended field is as safe to
// step as either end of it. Nothing else in this file is allowed to break that
// without paying for it: every non-rigid deform below states its Jacobian
// bound and gLip divides it back out, exactly as hyperspace_frag does with
// uLipschitz.
//
// ART DIRECTION, in one sentence: the seam is the subject. Where the two
// skeletons disagree, the surface belongs to neither one - it is the frontier
// of the transformation - and that is the part of the body that glows. When
// the morph settles onto a single skeleton the glow goes out, so the frame
// tells you at a glance whether the organism is resting or changing.
