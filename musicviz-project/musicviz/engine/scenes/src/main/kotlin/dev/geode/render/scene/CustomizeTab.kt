/**
 * The Customize panel's tabs, in the order the product spec names them.
 *
 * [SHAPE], [COLOR], [MOTION], [FX] and [REACTIVITY] are the five the spec asks for and every
 * style has them. [SCENE] holds the choices about the style itself rather than about a
 * parameter (how it transitions in, whether the engine may pick for you). The last three are
 * per-family control surfaces the panel only offers when that family is on screen.
