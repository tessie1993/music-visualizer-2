/**
 * The live drive the visuals run on.
 *
 * WHY: the picture has to move on the signal as it arrives, frame by frame — not on a
 * tempo grid, a beat tracker's guess or an offline timeline. `transient` fires on the
 * frame an onset is heard and carries its strength; `rms`, `centroid`, the band
 * envelopes and the stereo field are all instantaneous too. Everything the scenes used
 * to take from `beat` / `beatStrength` / `bpm` / `sectionIndex` / `progress` is derived
 * from those here instead, so an un-analysed source (live input, a file the analyser has
 * not reached yet) reacts exactly like an analysed one, and nothing waits a bar to catch
 * up with what you can already hear.
