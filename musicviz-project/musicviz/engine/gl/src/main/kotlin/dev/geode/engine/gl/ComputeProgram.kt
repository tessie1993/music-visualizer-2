/**
 * A linked compute program, and the compile/link discipline that gets one.
 *
 * ### Why the reporting is louder than the graphics path's
 *
 * `GlUtil.buildProgramReporting` hands a failure to the scene, which shows "unavailable on this
 * GPU" and the user sees a message. A compute step that fails to compile has **no on-screen
 * symptom at all** — the layer falls back to the fragment path and the picture is correct. That
 * is the right behaviour and it is also how a compute shader stays broken for a year: nobody
 * finds out. So a failure here logs the driver's message *and* the numbered source, once, at
 * WARN. The cost is one log line per process on a device that is going to run the fragment
 * path anyway; the alternative is a tier that quietly never engages.
 *
 * ### Ownership
 *
 * [release] deletes the GL object and needs a live context. [forget] drops the handle without
 * calling GL, for the context-loss path where the object is already gone and deleting it would
 * be a call into a dead context. They are not interchangeable — the same distinction
 * `RenderTarget` and the scenes make.
