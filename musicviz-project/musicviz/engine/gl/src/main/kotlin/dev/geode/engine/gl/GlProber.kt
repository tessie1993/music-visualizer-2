 * Fills a [GlProbeReport] from a live GL context.

 * **Every function here requires a current GL context and must run on the thread that owns
 * it** — the GLSurfaceView render thread, or the throwaway thread that made
 * [EglProbeHarness]' context current. Nothing here touches Android storage or preferences;
 * turning facts into a decision and persisting them is [DeviceGl]'s job.
 *
 * Three properties this file is built around, in the order they matter:
 *
 * 1. **Behaviour, not advertisement.** §6.3's rule is "never infer support from the GLES
 *    version string alone". So a format is renderable only after a draw and a `glReadPixels`
 *    agree; vertex texture fetch is proven by fetching and reading the result back; the timer
 *    query is trusted only after it returns a plausible non-zero duration with the disjoint
 *    flag clear. "Attachable" and "correct" are different claims, and drivers lie about the
 *    second one far more often than the first.
 * 2. **It cannot take the process down.** Every step is individually guarded; a step that
 *    throws degrades to "not supported" and the app keeps running on the baseline, which is
 *    always correct. The only thing rethrown is cancellation, which is not an error.
 * 3. **It leaves no trace.** Every GL object is registered with the arena and deleted on
 *    every path, and every piece of context state is captured before and restored after. This
 *    runs before the first frame; an object leaked here is leaked for the session, and a
 *    blend mode left enabled here is a rendering bug three files away.
 *
 * This is explicitly **not** a hot path — it runs once per process, so ordinary allocation is
 * fine here and the "reuse preallocated buffers" rule that governs the render loop does not
 * apply.

     * Captures the slice of context state the probe writes, neutralises it, and puts it back.
     *
     * The probe can run on a throwaway context where all of this is already at its default —
     * but it can also run on the app's own context in `onSurfaceCreated`, and there it runs
     * before the first frame. Anything left changed here becomes a rendering bug in a file that
     * never mentions probing.
     *
     * Three of these are easy to miss and each one silently corrupts a *verdict* rather than
     * causing an error:
     * - a **sampler object** bound to unit 0 overrides the texture's own filter parameters, so
     *   the filter probe would measure the caller's sampler instead of the format;
     * - **dithering** is enabled by default and perturbs 8-bit writes, which is exactly the
     *   exactness the RGBA8 probe claims to measure;
     * - a **pixel pack buffer** left bound redirects `glReadPixels` into that buffer, so every
     *   readback would return whatever the probe's own scratch memory happened to hold.
