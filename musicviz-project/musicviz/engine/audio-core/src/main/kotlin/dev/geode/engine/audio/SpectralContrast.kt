/**
 * Octave-band spectral contrast — how far each band's peaks stand above its
 * own floor. A pure tone is all contrast; broadband noise is none; real
 * timbres sit between, differently per octave, which is what makes this a
 * texture descriptor where the mel bands are a level one.
 *
 * The published formulation (Jiang et al., ICME 2002), stated exactly as
 * the corpus oracle recomputes it: octave bands from [fminHz], and per band
 * the dB difference between the means of the top and bottom [alpha]
 * fraction of the band's POWER bins (at least one bin each), floored at
 * [Mfcc.LOG_POWER_FLOOR].
 *
 * A configuration that leaves any band empty refuses at construction — a
 * per-frame divide by zero is not an acceptable place to discover it.
 * Allocates nothing per frame.
